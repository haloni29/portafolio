                        <p>I am a university student looking for work with a
                            desire to learn and start my work experience,
                            I love everything that has to do with web engineering,
                            whether it be the design, creation and testing of the same. I love being frontend and seeing how I can
                            fix a web page so that it looks elegant and
                            presentable for the client, and also being backend
                            and being able to help in everything that has to do with database management or the saving, creation,
                            updating and deleting of data.
                            </p>
